Github Collapse Comments
====================

On GitHub, I often find it difficult to filter out the PR comments which still
need to be addressed from ones which won't be addressed (or are purely
converstional).

This is a simple Chrome extension to collapse comment threads while viewing
the "Conversation" on a GitHub pull request. Simply click the header text of a
comment thread to collapse it.

### Installation

Check out this repository, enable extensions "Developer mode", and drag the folder
into the extensions page.

### Acknowledgements

This is based on [Matthew Robinson's Github-Collapse-Diff extension](https://github.com/matthewrobertson/Github-Collapse-Diff).
(I'm not usually a web developer ;))
